42 Companion is a Visual Studio Code extension that helps you manage your 42 projects. It supports intellisense and fixes for Norminette, Makefiles, headers and more!

## Getting Started

To get started, you can either download the extension from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) or download one of the [Releases](https://github.com/IanToujou/42-Companion-VS-Code/releases).

## Features

### Norminette Intellisense

Norminette intellisense helps you find norm errors in your code. It will highlight the errors for .c and .h files.

### Header Insertion

Configurable 42 headers are available and fill automatically be added to .c and .h files.

Makefiles are not flagged by Norminette, but they are defined in the norm. This extension will help you find errors
in the makefile, and potential issues.
