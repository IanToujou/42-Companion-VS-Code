42 Companion is a Visual Studio Code extension that helps you manage your 42 projects. It supports intellisense and fixes for Norminette, Makefiles, headers and more!

## Getting Started

To get started, you can either download the extension from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) or download one of the [Releases](https://github.com/IanToujou/42-Companion-VS-Code/releases).

## Features

### Norminette Intellisense

Norminette intellisense helps you find norm errors in your code. It will highlight the errors for .c and .h files.

### Makefile Support

Makefiles are not flagged by Norminette, but they are defined in the norm. This extension will help you find errors
in the makefile, and potential issues.

## Support

Please make sure to have read the documentation regarding your issue.
